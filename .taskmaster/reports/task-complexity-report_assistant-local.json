		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Kong Plugin Project and Local Development Stack",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization into: (1) Scaffold plugin directory and files (handler.lua, schema.lua, daos.lua if needed), (2) Write minimal plugin logic and logging, (3) Author docker-compose.yml with Kong Gateway 3.x, Postgres, and demo upstream, (4) Mount plugin and configure Kong to load it, (5) Verify plugin loads and logs via curl and Kong stdout.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex due to the need to scaffold a Lua plugin, set up a multi-service Docker Compose stack, and ensure correct plugin mounting and verification. Each step is standard but requires attention to Kong's plugin loading mechanics and Docker best practices[1][2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Schema and Dry-Run Mode",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define schema.lua fields and validation logic, (2) Implement config parsing and defaults, (3) Integrate dry_run gating in enforcement paths, (4) Ensure Admin API/Konnect compatibility and test with various configs.",
			"reasoning": "Defining a robust schema and dry-run logic requires careful validation, compatibility with declarative config, and gating all enforcement logic. This is a common but non-trivial pattern in Kong plugin development, especially with multiple config fields and compatibility requirements[3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add Access and Log Phase Instrumentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Capture request metadata in access phase, (2) Capture response metadata in log phase, (3) Maintain per-IP/global counters in ngx.shared.dict, (4) Emit structured logs, (5) Benchmark and optimize for <10ms overhead.",
			"reasoning": "Instrumentation across phases with efficient shared dict usage and structured logging is moderately complex, requiring knowledge of Kong's request lifecycle, OpenResty, and performance tuning[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Static Rule-Based Threat Detection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Implement IP blacklist enforcement, (2) Implement HTTP method denylist, (3) Add path regex filtering, (4) Structure and emit incident records with required fields.",
			"reasoning": "Rule-based enforcement is a standard pattern but requires careful implementation for O(1) lookups and correct incident structuring. Each rule type is distinct and should be isolated for clarity and testability[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Threshold and Anomaly Detection",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement burst detection logic, (2) Implement per-IP rate spike detection, (3) Implement error-rate spike detection, (4) Implement payload size anomaly detection, (5) Use sliding window/EMA in ngx.shared.dict, (6) Optimize for lock-free, lightweight computation.",
			"reasoning": "Anomaly detection with sliding windows and EMAs in a distributed, high-performance environment is complex, requiring advanced data structures, efficient shared memory usage, and careful performance considerations[2]."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Core Remediation via Admin API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Secure Admin API access and config, (2) Map incidents to Kong entities, (3) Apply rate-limiting/request-termination/ACLs via Admin API, (4) Ensure idempotency and implement retry/backoff, (5) Emit audit logs for all actions.",
			"reasoning": "Automating remediation via the Admin API involves secure integration, entity resolution, idempotency, and robust error handling, all of which are advanced patterns in Kong automation[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Remediation: Route/Service Modification and Rollback",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Detect mass 5xx events and correlate with config changes, (2) Modify Service/Route to reroute traffic, (3) Integrate with decK/Konnect or snapshot logic, (4) Implement rollback mechanism, (5) Add guardrails for safe rollback, (6) Validate final state via Admin API.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need for correlation logic, safe modification and rollback of Kong entities, and integration with external tools or snapshot management, all requiring advanced operational safeguards[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Notifications and Incident Export",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement Slack/Email/webhook notification logic, (2) Structure JSON payloads with incident details, (3) Implement persistence to Postgres/Redis, (4) Add exponential backoff and retry, (5) Implement deduplication to prevent alert storms.",
			"reasoning": "Sending notifications and exporting incidents involves integration with external systems, structured payloads, persistence, and robust alerting logic, which are moderately complex and require careful error handling[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Status and Incident Reporting Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement read-only endpoint via Kong Service/Route, (2) Secure with key-auth and access controls, (3) Return plugin status, config snapshot, and recent incidents, (4) Validate JSON structure and unauthorized access handling.",
			"reasoning": "Exposing a secure, read-only status endpoint is a common pattern, but requires careful attention to access controls and data serialization. The logic is straightforward but must be robust[2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Operator Feedback Loop and Final Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement feedback path for confirming/undoing remediation, (2) Update thresholds/allowlists via feedback, (3) Implement action revert logic, (4) Finalize README with installation/configuration, (5) Add sample YAML and Docker workflows, (6) Write and validate busted test suite.",
			"reasoning": "Combining operator feedback mechanisms with comprehensive documentation and packaging is complex, requiring both robust backend logic and high-quality developer experience deliverables[2]."
