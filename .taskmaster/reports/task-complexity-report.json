		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Plugin Skeleton and Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of Kong plugin skeleton and Docker development environment into subtasks covering: repository initialization, Kong plugin structure creation, Docker Compose configuration for Kong/Postgres/demo API, plugin lifecycle implementation, development tool setup, testing framework configuration, local deployment verification, and documentation of the development workflow.",
			"reasoning": "This foundational task requires multiple technical components: Kong plugin architecture knowledge, Docker orchestration, Lua development setup, and testing infrastructure. Each component has specific requirements and interdependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Traffic Monitoring and Logging Hooks",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing Kong lifecycle hooks covering: access phase instrumentation, log phase implementation, data extraction logic for request/response metadata, performance optimization for minimal overhead, logging backend integration, and comprehensive testing of all captured data points.",
			"reasoning": "Requires deep understanding of Kong's request lifecycle, efficient data capture mechanisms, and careful performance considerations. Multiple integration points need proper implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Static and Threshold-Based Threat Detectors",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: IP blacklist rule engine, request method anomaly detection, rate limiting logic, burst detection algorithms, configuration schema design for rules, YAML/JSON parser implementation, rule evaluation engine, unit test suite with busted framework, and integration tests for various threat patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Complex task involving multiple detection algorithms, configuration management, and extensive testing requirements. Each detector type needs separate implementation and testing strategies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Gateway for Advanced Anomaly Detection",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: AI Gateway integration architecture design, LLM API client implementation, request/response marshalling for AI analysis, payload sanitization and preparation, AI scoring interpretation logic, configuration toggle system, fallback mechanisms for AI service failures, mock AI service for testing, performance impact analysis, and end-to-end integration testing with real AI services.",
			"reasoning": "Highest complexity due to external AI service integration, complex data transformation requirements, error handling, performance considerations, and need for sophisticated testing strategies including mocking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Remediation Actions via Admin API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: Admin API client implementation, rate-limiting action module, IP/consumer blocking logic, route disabling functionality, policy engine for action selection, transaction safety mechanisms, rollback capabilities for actions, and comprehensive testing of each remediation type.",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful implementation of multiple Kong Admin API interactions, policy logic, and safety mechanisms to prevent accidental service disruption. Each action type needs separate implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Notification and Reporting System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: webhook notification client, Slack integration module, email notification system, alert payload formatter with detailed incident information, and testing with mock receivers for each notification channel.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward integration task with clear boundaries. Main complexity is in supporting multiple notification channels and ensuring reliable message delivery."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Plugin Status and Incident Reporting Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: HTTP endpoint service design, status data aggregation logic, incident history storage and retrieval, API response formatting, endpoint security implementation with authentication/authorization.",
			"reasoning": "Standard API endpoint development with moderate complexity in data aggregation and security considerations. Clear scope and well-defined requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Declarative Configuration and 'Dry Run' Mode",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: configuration schema finalization, YAML/JSON parser enhancement, dry run mode flag implementation, action simulation logging system, Admin API configuration management integration, and testing of configuration updates and dry run scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful design of configuration schema and implementation of dual execution modes. Testing needs to cover both actual and simulated execution paths."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Remediation: Config Rollback",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: configuration history tracking mechanism, error spike detection algorithm, correlation analysis between config changes and errors, rollback decision logic, Admin API rollback execution, safety checks to prevent cascading rollbacks, and testing with simulated bad configurations.",
			"reasoning": "Complex feature requiring sophisticated correlation analysis, careful rollback logic, and extensive safety mechanisms to prevent unintended consequences. Integration with external tools adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Operator Feedback Loop and Finalize Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: feedback API endpoint development, action reversal logic implementation, comprehensive README creation, configuration examples preparation, and demo scenario documentation with step-by-step instructions.",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity as it builds on existing infrastructure. Main effort is in documentation quality and ensuring feedback mechanism properly integrates with existing actions."
