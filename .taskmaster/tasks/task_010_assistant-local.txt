# Task ID: 10
# Title: Operator Feedback Loop and Final Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add feedback capabilities to confirm/undo remediation, finalize README, packaging, and tests.
# Details:
Feedback updates thresholds/allowlists and can revert actions. Documentation includes installation, configuration, sample YAML, Docker workflows, and running the busted test suite.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger an auto-block, then use the feedback path to undo it and verify the block is removed. Run the full test suite and follow README steps from a clean environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Operator Feedback Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop UI and/or API endpoints that allow operators to confirm or undo remediation actions, ensuring feedback is captured for each remediation event.
### Details:
Feedback should be actionable, enabling operators to either confirm the applied remediation or revert it. The system must log all feedback events for traceability.

## 2. Integrate Feedback with Thresholds and Allowlists [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Ensure that operator feedback dynamically updates detection thresholds and allowlists, adapting future remediation logic based on confirmed or reverted actions.
### Details:
When an operator confirms a remediation, thresholds or allowlists should be adjusted to reinforce the decision. If an action is undone, the system should learn to avoid similar false positives.

## 3. Finalize Comprehensive README Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete the README to cover installation, configuration, sample YAML, Docker workflows, and instructions for running the busted test suite.
### Details:
Documentation must be clear, up-to-date, and include practical examples for all supported deployment and testing scenarios.

## 4. Package and Release Artifacts [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Prepare the project for distribution, including packaging source code, dependencies, and Docker images as needed for deployment.
### Details:
Ensure all packaging scripts and Dockerfiles are tested and produce reproducible builds. Artifacts should be versioned and ready for release.

## 5. Validate and Expand Automated Test Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Review, update, and expand the automated test suite to cover feedback loop logic, remediation confirmation/undo, and all documented workflows.
### Details:
Tests should simulate real operator feedback scenarios, including edge cases for reverting actions and updating thresholds. Ensure coverage for all documented features.
