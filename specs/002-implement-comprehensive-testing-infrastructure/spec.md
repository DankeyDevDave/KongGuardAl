# Feature Specification: Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests (targeting 80%+ coverage), integ

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-comprehensive-testing-infrastructure`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests (targeting 80%+ coverage), integration tests for component interactions, and E2E tests for critical workflows. Add performance and load testing capabilities. Create test fixtures, mocks for external services (AI APIs, TAXII servers), and automated test execution pipeline to address the current lack of testing coverage."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** Kong plugin developer and DevOps engineer  
**I want** comprehensive testing infrastructure for KongGuardAI plugin  
**So that** I can confidently deploy changes, catch regressions early, and ensure the security plugin works reliably in production environments

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer makes changes to threat detection logic, **When** they run unit tests, **Then** the tests should provide 80%+ code coverage and complete in under 2 minutes
2. **Given** the AI service integration code exists, **When** integration tests run, **Then** they should test against mocked AI services (Claude, GPT, Gemini) and verify correct request/response handling
3. **Given** the TAXII threat intelligence integration is implemented, **When** integration tests execute, **Then** they should test against a mock TAXII server and verify threat data ingestion workflows
4. **Given** a full Kong environment with the plugin is running, **When** E2E tests execute, **Then** they should verify complete threat detection workflows from request ingestion to response blocking
5. **Given** performance requirements exist for the plugin, **When** load tests run, **Then** they should verify the plugin can handle 1000+ requests/second with acceptable latency
6. **Given** tests are executed in CI/CD pipeline, **When** any test fails, **Then** the pipeline should fail and provide clear error reporting and test artifacts

### Edge Cases

- AI service timeouts and fallback behavior testing
- TAXII server connectivity issues and retry mechanisms
- Memory pressure scenarios during high-load testing
- Configuration validation across different Kong environments
- Concurrent request processing with shared state

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement unit tests achieving minimum 80% code coverage for all Lua modules
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide mock implementations for all external services (AI APIs, TAXII servers, databases)
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement integration tests for component interactions (AI engine, TAXII client, compliance reporter)
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement E2E tests for critical user workflows (threat detection, compliance reporting, incident response)
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement performance and load testing capabilities measuring throughput and latency
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide automated test execution pipeline integrated with CI/CD
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate test reports with coverage metrics and failure analysis
- **FR-008**: System SHOULD implement test fixtures for common test scenarios and data sets
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD provide test environment setup and teardown automation
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD implement parallel test execution to minimize testing time
- **FR-011**: System SHOULD provide security-specific test scenarios (injection attacks, authentication bypasses)

### Key Entities

- **TestSuite**: Organized collection of unit, integration, and E2E tests with consistent execution framework
- **MockServiceProvider**: Mock implementations of external services (AI APIs, TAXII servers) for testing isolation
- **TestFixture**: Reusable test data and configuration sets for consistent test scenarios
- **TestEnvironment**: Containerized test environment with Kong, plugin, and mock services
- **PerformanceTestHarness**: Load testing framework for measuring plugin performance under various conditions
- **TestReporter**: Test execution reporting system with coverage metrics and failure analysis
- **CIPipeline**: Automated testing pipeline integration with version control and deployment systems
