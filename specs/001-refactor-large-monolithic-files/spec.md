# Feature Specification: Refactor large monolithic files (handler.lua 2674 lines, schema.lua 2041 lines) into smaller, focuse

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-large-monolithic-files`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Refactor large monolithic files (handler.lua 2674 lines, schema.lua 2041 lines) into smaller, focused modules with clear separation of concerns. Extract common functionality into shared utilities, implement dependency injection for better testability, and create abstraction layers for external service integration. This addresses the code organization issues identified in the analysis while maintaining backward compatibility."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** Kong plugin developer and maintainer  
**I want** the large monolithic files (handler.lua, schema.lua) to be refactored into smaller, focused modules  
**So that** the codebase is more maintainable, testable, and allows for easier collaboration and feature development

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** handler.lua contains 2674 lines of mixed responsibilities, **When** the refactoring is complete, **Then** the file should be split into logical modules (request processing, response handling, threat detection, etc.) with each module under 500 lines
2. **Given** schema.lua contains 2041 lines of configuration validation, **When** the refactoring is complete, **Then** the schema should be modularized by feature area (AI config, compliance config, threat detection config) with clear interfaces
3. **Given** a developer wants to modify threat detection logic, **When** they locate the relevant code, **Then** they should find it in a dedicated module with clear dependencies and testable interfaces
4. **Given** the refactored modules exist, **When** any module is loaded, **Then** it should use dependency injection for external services (AI engines, TAXII clients, databases)
5. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** the plugin is deployed, **Then** all existing functionality should work identically with no breaking changes

### Edge Cases

- Large configuration schemas that span multiple feature areas need careful decomposition
- Circular dependencies between handler phases and utility functions
- Memory usage patterns may change with module loading
- Plugin initialization order dependencies with external services

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST decompose handler.lua into focused modules (request processing, threat detection, response handling, logging, AI integration)
- **FR-002**: System MUST decompose schema.lua into feature-specific configuration modules (ai_config, compliance_config, threat_config, performance_config)
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement dependency injection pattern for external service integration (AI engines, TAXII clients, database adapters)
- **FR-004**: System MUST create abstraction layers for external services to enable testing and service substitution
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract common utility functions into shared modules (logging, validation, error handling, memory management)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing configuration and API interfaces
- **FR-007**: System SHOULD reduce individual file size to under 500 lines where feasible
- **FR-008**: System SHOULD implement clear module interfaces with documented dependencies
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD enable unit testing of individual modules in isolation
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD improve code organization to support parallel development by multiple developers

### Key Entities

- **ModuleRegistry**: Central registry for loading and managing refactored modules with dependency resolution
- **ServiceContainer**: Dependency injection container for external service abstractions
- **ConfigurationSchema**: Modular configuration validation system with feature-specific schemas
- **HandlerModule**: Individual handler modules for specific Kong plugin phases (access, log, etc.)
- **UtilityModule**: Shared utility modules for common functionality (logging, validation, memory management)
- **ServiceAbstraction**: Interface abstractions for external services (AI, TAXII, database) to enable testing and substitution
