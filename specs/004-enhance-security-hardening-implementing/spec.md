# Feature Specification: Enhance security hardening by implementing rate limiting for AI service calls, adding request size l

**Feature Branch**: `004-enhance-security-hardening-implementing`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhance security hardening by implementing rate limiting for AI service calls, adding request size limits and validation, enhancing authentication mechanisms, and adding security headers and CORS policies. Address potential security concerns from the complex configuration surface and external AI service dependencies."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** security engineer and Kong administrator  
**I want** enhanced security hardening for KongGuardAI plugin  
**So that** the plugin itself cannot be exploited or abused, and external dependencies (AI services) are protected from abuse

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an attacker attempts to overwhelm AI services through the plugin, **When** rate limiting is active, **Then** AI service calls should be throttled per client/IP and excessive requests should be blocked
2. **Given** a malicious client sends oversized requests to trigger resource exhaustion, **When** request size limits are enforced, **Then** requests exceeding configured limits should be rejected before processing
3. **Given** an unauthorized user attempts to access plugin configuration endpoints, **When** enhanced authentication is enabled, **Then** access should be denied and the attempt should be logged
4. **Given** a web application tries to access the plugin's APIs from a restricted domain, **When** CORS policies are configured, **Then** cross-origin requests should be properly controlled based on security policies
5. **Given** an attacker attempts to exploit plugin vulnerabilities through configuration manipulation, **When** security headers are properly set, **Then** common attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking) should be mitigated

### Edge Cases

- AI service rate limits during legitimate high-traffic periods requiring burst allowances
- Large file uploads for legitimate threat analysis requiring size limit exceptions
- Multi-tenant environments requiring tenant-specific rate limiting and authentication
- Emergency access scenarios requiring temporary security policy bypasses
- Configuration changes during runtime affecting active security policies

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement rate limiting for AI service calls with configurable limits per client, IP, and time window
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce request size limits for all incoming requests with configurable maximum sizes
- **FR-003**: System MUST enhance authentication mechanisms with multi-factor support and API key management
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement comprehensive security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **FR-005**: System MUST configure CORS policies with whitelist-based domain control and credential handling
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate and sanitize all configuration inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement secure session management with timeout and rotation policies
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all security events with detailed context for threat analysis and forensics
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD implement IP allowlisting/blocklisting capabilities for access control
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD provide security monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
- **FR-011**: System SHOULD implement encrypted communication for all external service interactions
- **FR-012**: System SHOULD provide security audit trails with integrity verification

### Key Entities

- **RateLimiter**: Traffic control system for AI service calls and general API access with sliding window algorithms
- **RequestValidator**: Input validation and sanitization system for all plugin inputs and configurations
- **AuthenticationManager**: Enhanced authentication system supporting multiple factors and secure credential management
- **SecurityHeaderManager**: HTTP security header management system with policy-based configuration
- **CORSPolicyManager**: Cross-origin resource sharing policy enforcement system with domain whitelisting
- **SecurityAuditor**: Security event logging and monitoring system with real-time threat detection
- **AccessController**: IP-based access control system with allowlist/blocklist management
