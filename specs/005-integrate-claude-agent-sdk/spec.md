# Feature Specification: Feature: Integrate Claude Agent SDK into KongGuardAI to augment autonomous security operations.

Obj

**Feature Branch**: `005-integrate-claude-agent-sdk`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Specification Version**: 0.0.52  
**Input**: User description: "Feature: Integrate Claude Agent SDK into KongGuardAI to augment autonomous security operations.

Objectives:
- Add three specialized agents leveraging Claude Agent SDK: Security Triage Copilot, Adaptive Policy Tuner, and DevOps Assistant.
- Start with read-only triage pilot in staging; gate any config/apply actions behind human approval and strict tool allowlists.
- Ensure redaction/compliance for proprietary and sensitive data.

Scope:
- Agent definitions and prompts under .claude/agents/ with least-privilege permissions.
- Hooks and tool permissions in .claude/settings.json to strictly allow selected scripts/commands.
- Python glue under ai-service/agents/ exposing telemetry and safe MCP tools (metrics, logs, Supabase ops, FastAPI analytics) with redaction.
- CI integration for a Security Review Gate (read-only checks on PRs) and optional demo orchestration helpers.
- Staging rollout via docker-compose.dashboard.yml; no production enablement until sign-off.

Data Sources & Integrations:
- Logs in logs/, analysis-reports/, and errors.log; metrics in attack_metrics.db; FastAPI endpoints in ai-service/app.py; Prometheus/Grafana when available.
- Repo config touchpoints: kong-plugin, config/docker/*.yml, ml_config/, ml_models/ (read for recommendations; writes are proposed via diffs only by default).

Security & Compliance:
- System prompts mandate non-exfiltration, PII redaction, and no automatic external sharing.
- Redaction layer that strips secrets, tokens, and sensitive payloads from tool outputs.
- Permission mode set to allowlist; disallow network calls unless explicitly required (e.g., localhost FastAPI).

Risks & Mitigations:
- Change control: human approval required; generated diffs reviewed via PR.
- Latency/cost: use prompt caching; batch analyses off-peak; streaming mode only for interactive triage.
- Observability: structured logs for agent actions; simple metrics counters for tool calls and failures.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Agents can summarize incidents from current telemetry with >90% coverage of key signals (top IPs, categories, error spikes) in staging.
- Policy tuner generates safe configuration diffs (no direct apply) consistent with observed patterns; flagged for review.
- CI gate blocks PRs missing required security checks and surfaces actionable suggestions without flaky failures.
- All tools pass unit tests, enforce redaction, and adhere to allowlists.

Rollout Plan:
- Phase 1: Security Triage Copilot (read-only) in staging.
- Phase 2: DevOps Assistant in CI (read-only checks).
- Phase 3: Adaptive Policy Tuner proposing diffs; later optional controlled apply with approval.

Deliverables:
- .claude/agents/{security-triage.md,policy-tuner.md,devops-assistant.md}
- .claude/settings.json with hooks and permissions
- ai-service/agents/ (wrappers, MCP tools, redaction utils, tests)
- CI workflow additions for security checks
- Staging compose overrides and minimal docs/internal runbook notes

## Constitutional Alignment

This specification adheres to the project constitution established in `/memory/constitution.md`. All requirements and design decisions must comply with constitutional principles including:

- **User-Centric Design**: All features demonstrate clear user value
- **Quality Standards**: Test-driven development and comprehensive coverage
- **Architectural Governance**: Consistent patterns and maintainable design
- **Development Workflow**: Spec-driven approach with proper documentation

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints, constitutional alignment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements (FR-xxx format)
   → Each requirement must be testable and constitutional
   → Mark ambiguous requirements for clarification phase
6. Identify Key Entities and Business Rules
7. Define Success Criteria and Acceptance Tests
8. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: REQUIRE clarification phase
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
   → Verify constitutional compliance
9. Return: SUCCESS (ready for clarification phase if needed, then planning)
```

## Specification Guidelines (v0.0.52)

### Purpose and Scope
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (not HOW to implement)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- Must align with constitutional principles and project governance
- No technology stack, APIs, or implementation details

### Quality Standards
- All requirements must be testable and measurable
- Success criteria must be clearly defined
- Edge cases and error conditions must be considered
- Accessibility and performance requirements included

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature  
- **Clarification markers**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question] for ambiguous areas
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** [user role/persona]  
**I want** [capability or goal]  
**So that** [business value or benefit]

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific user personas and their primary goals]

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Happy Path**
- **Given** [initial context and preconditions]
- **When** [user performs primary action]  
- **Then** [expected system response and outcomes]
- **And** [additional verification points]

**Scenario 2: Alternative Path**
- **Given** [alternative context]
- **When** [different user action]
- **Then** [alternative system response]
