# Feature Specification: Simplify and enhance configuration management by creating configuration profiles for common use case

**Feature Branch**: `003-simplify-enhance-configuration-management`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Simplify and enhance configuration management by creating configuration profiles for common use cases, adding validation with helpful error messages, implementing configuration templates for different environments, and adding configuration migration tools for version upgrades. This addresses the overwhelming 2000+ configuration schema fields and complex nested structures."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** Kong administrator and security engineer  
**I want** simplified and enhanced configuration management for KongGuardAI  
**So that** I can easily configure the plugin for different environments without being overwhelmed by 2000+ configuration options

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I need to configure KongGuardAI for basic threat detection, **When** I use a configuration profile, **Then** I should have a pre-configured setup requiring only essential customizations (AI API keys, threat thresholds)
2. **Given** I have an invalid configuration, **When** the plugin validates the config, **Then** I should receive clear, actionable error messages explaining what's wrong and how to fix it
3. **Given** I need to migrate from version 1.0 to 2.0 configuration, **When** I use the migration tool, **Then** my existing configuration should be automatically converted with warnings about deprecated options
4. **Given** I'm setting up a GDPR compliance environment, **When** I select the GDPR template, **Then** all necessary privacy settings should be pre-configured with appropriate defaults
5. **Given** I have complex nested configuration requirements, **When** I use the configuration wizard, **Then** I should be guided through a step-by-step process with validation at each step

### Edge Cases

- Configuration conflicts between different compliance frameworks (GDPR vs CCPA requirements)
- Invalid AI model configurations that could break threat detection
- Memory and performance settings that could impact Kong Gateway stability
- Migration of configurations with deprecated or removed features
- Validation of encrypted configuration values and secrets

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide configuration profiles for common use cases (basic security, GDPR compliance, enterprise threat detection, development/testing)
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement comprehensive configuration validation with clear, actionable error messages
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide configuration templates for different environments (development, staging, production)
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement configuration migration tools for version upgrades with deprecation warnings
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize configuration schema into logical groups (security, compliance, performance, AI integration)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide configuration wizard interface for guided setup process
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate configuration dependencies and conflicts between different feature areas
- **FR-008**: System SHOULD provide configuration export/import functionality for environment replication
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD implement configuration versioning and rollback capabilities
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD provide configuration documentation generator for current settings
- **FR-011**: System SHOULD implement secure handling of sensitive configuration values (API keys, tokens)

### Key Entities

- **ConfigurationProfile**: Pre-defined configuration sets for common deployment scenarios
- **ConfigurationTemplate**: Environment-specific configuration templates with placeholders for customization
- **ConfigurationValidator**: Validation engine with detailed error reporting and suggestion system
- **MigrationTool**: Automated configuration migration system for version upgrades
- **ConfigurationWizard**: Interactive setup assistant for guided configuration creation
- **ConfigurationSchema**: Organized, hierarchical configuration structure with validation rules and documentation
