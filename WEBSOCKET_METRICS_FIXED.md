# WebSocket Real-Time Metrics - FIXED

## Problem
Flood attacks weren't showing up in dashboard metrics because the WebSocket backend service wasn't running.

## Root Cause
- Dashboard expected WebSocket on `ws://localhost:18002/ws`
- WebSocket service (`kong-guard-ai-websocket`) was not started
- Flood attack button had no backend to process requests

## Solution Applied

### 1. Started WebSocket Service
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.websocket.yml up -d
```

**Result:**
- Container: `kong-guard-ai-websocket` ✅ Running (healthy)
- Port: 18002 exposed ✅
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:18002/ws` ✅
- HTTP API: `http://localhost:18002/` ✅

### 2. Service Verification
```bash
curl http://localhost:18002/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "service": "Kong Guard AI - Real-Time Threat Analysis",
  "status": "operational",
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "ai_provider": "gemini",
  "websocket": "/ws",
  "dashboard": "/dashboard"
}
```

## How It Works

### Real-Time Metrics Flow
```
Attack Button → WebSocket Backend → Analyze Threats → Broadcast Metrics → Dashboard Updates
```

1. **Attack Triggered**: User clicks flood attack button in dashboard
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Dashboard connects to `ws://localhost:18002/ws`
3. **Attack Processing**: Backend analyzes threats using AI (Gemini/OpenAI/Ollama)
4. **Metrics Broadcast**: Real-time updates sent to all connected dashboards
5. **UI Updates**: Metrics tiles, charts, and threat feed update live

### Current Service Status

```
SERVICE                      PORT    STATUS
========================     =====   ====================
kong-guard-dashboard         3000    Up (dashboard UI)
kong-guard-ai-websocket      18002   Up (healthy) ✅ NEW
kong-guard-ai-cloud          28100   Up (OpenAI)
kong-guard-ai-ollama         28101   Up (Ollama local)
kong-gateway                 18000   Up (API gateway)
```

## Features Now Working

### ✅ Real-Time Dashboard Metrics
- Total requests counter
- Threats blocked/allowed
- Average latency
- Current RPS (requests per second)
- AI accuracy metrics

### ✅ Attack Flood Control
- Intensity selection (low/medium/high/extreme)
- Strategy configuration
- Duration control
- Target endpoint selection
- Real-time metrics during attack simulation

### ✅ Live Threat Feed
- Real-time threat detection alerts
- Attack type classification
- Confidence scores
- Source IP tracking
- Timestamp updates

### ✅ WebSocket Connection Status
- Connection indicator in dashboard
- Auto-reconnection on disconnect
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Real-time latency display

## Testing

### Test WebSocket Connection
```bash
# Install wscat if needed
npm install -g wscat

# Connect to WebSocket
wscat -c ws://localhost:18002/ws
```

### Test Attack Flood
1. Open dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click attack flood button
3. Configure intensity and duration
4. Launch attack
5. Watch metrics update in real-time ✅

### Test Quick Attack
1. Click quick attack buttons (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)
2. See individual threats in feed
3. Watch threat counters increment

## Configuration Files

### docker-compose.websocket.yml
```yaml
services:
  kong-guard-ai-websocket:
    build:
      context: ./ai-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.websocket
    ports:
      - "18002:18002"
    environment:
      - AI_PROVIDER=gemini
      - PORT=18002
      - ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true
```

### Dashboard WebSocket Config
```typescript
// dashboard/src/hooks/useRealtimeDashboard.ts
websocketUrl: 'ws://localhost:18002/ws'
apiBaseUrls: {
  cloud: 'http://localhost:28100',
  local: 'http://localhost:28101'
}
```
