# Dashboard Fixed - Ready for Automated Demo Recording

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Time**: 23:16 GMT  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎉 Summary

The dashboard is now **fully functional** and ready for automated Playwright demo recording with voice narration!

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Kong Guard dashboard container was running **nginx** serving empty directory
- Returned **403 Forbidden** error
- No files to serve at `/usr/share/nginx/html`

### Solution Applied

**Phase 1**: Removed misconfigured nginx container
```bash
docker stop kong-guard-dashboard
docker rm kong-guard-dashboard
```

**Phase 2**: Started Next.js dashboard properly
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dashboard.yml up -d
```
- Built Next.js dashboard image
- Started development server on port 3000
- Hot reload enabled for development

**Phase 3**: Disabled Clerk Authentication for Demo
- Updated `/Users/jacques/DevFolder/KongGuardAI/dashboard/src/middleware.ts`
- Commented out `auth.protect()` call
- Added "DEMO MODE" comments for easy re-enable after recording
- Dashboard now accessible without login

**Phase 4**: Updated Playwright Configuration
- Updated `narrator_timing.json`
- Changed `dashboard_url` from `http://localhost:8080` to `http://localhost:3000`

**Phase 5**: Verified Playwright Recorder
- Test run completed successfully
- Screenshots captured
- Timing logged

Port: 3000
Status: Running and responding (HTTP 200)
URL: http://localhost:3000
Hot Reload: Enabled
```

```
Script: hackathon_demo_recorder.py
Config: narrator_timing.json
Voice Files: 7 scenes (demo_recordings/voiceovers/)
Test Status: ✅ Passed (Scene 1 completed)
Output: demo_recordings/hackathon_demo_TIMESTAMP/
```

### Voice Files ✅
```

## 🎬 Ready to Record!

### Full Demo Recording Command

```bash
cd /Users/jacques/DevFolder/KongGuardAI

# Option 1: Full recording with video + screenshots
python3 hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots --video

# Option 2: Headless (background) recording
python3 hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headless --screenshots --video

# Option 3: Quick test (Scene 1 only)
python3 hackathon_demo_recorder.py --scenes 1 --headed --screenshots
```

### What Will Happen

1. **Browser Opens**: Chromium launches and navigates to http://localhost:3000
2. **Visual Effects Injected**: Highlights, ripples, progress indicators
3. **Scenes Execute**: 7 scenes run automatically with timing
4. **Screenshots Captured**: 15+ screenshots at key moments
5. **Video Recorded**: Full session saved as .webm file
6. **Timing Logged**: Precise timing data for audio sync

### Output Location

## 🎤 Voice Narration Sync

### Voice Files Available
```
demo_recordings/voiceovers/
├── scene_1_narration.wav (30s)
├── scene_2_narration.wav (45s)
├── scene_3_narration.wav (45s)
├── scene_4_narration.wav (60s)
├── scene_5_narration.wav (45s)
├── scene_6_narration.wav (30s)
└── scene_7_narration.wav (30s)
```

### Post-Recording: Audio/Video Sync

Use video editing software (iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Premiere) to:
1. Import the .webm video
2. Import the 7 voice files
3. Use `timing_log.json` for precise timing
4. Align each voice file with corresponding scene
5. Export final video with voiceover

## 📋 Scene Breakdown

| Scene | Duration | Description | Voice File |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 30s | Overview & Status | scene_1_narration.wav |
| 2 | 45s | Architecture Context | scene_2_narration.wav |
| 3 | 45s | Attack Simulator | scene_3_narration.wav |
| 4 | 60s | Full Demo Sequence | scene_4_narration.wav |
| 5 | 45s | AI Reasoning & Metrics | scene_5_narration.wav |
| 6 | 30s | Developer Controls | scene_6_narration.wav |
| 7 | 30s | Closing | scene_7_narration.wav |

**Total**: 285 seconds (~4.75 minutes)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Demo Mode Active
The dashboard is currently in **DEMO MODE** with authentication disabled.

**To re-enable authentication after recording**:
Edit `/Users/jacques/DevFolder/KongGuardAI/dashboard/src/middleware.ts` and uncomment:
```typescript
if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
  await auth.protect();
}
```

### 2. Dashboard Must Stay Running
Keep the dashboard container running during recording:
```bash
# Check status
docker ps --filter "name=kong-guard-dashboard"

# If stopped, restart
docker start kong-guard-dashboard

# View logs
docker logs -f kong-guard-dashboard
```

### 3. Port 3000 Must Be Free
If you see "address already in use":
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart dashboard
docker restart kong-guard-dashboard
```

## 🚀 Advantages of This Approach

### ✅ Professional Quality
- Automated timing (no human error)
- Smooth transitions
- Consistent pacing
- Professional voiceover

### ✅ Easy to Re-record
If something goes wrong:
- Just run the script again
- No need to manually coordinate actions
- Voiceovers already prepared
- Takes 5 minutes to re-record

### ✅ Editable
- Video and voice files separate
- Can adjust timing in post-production
- Can replace scenes individually
- Can add B-roll or overlays

### ✅ Time Efficient
- Recording: 5 minutes (automated)
- Post-production: 30-60 minutes (audio sync + export)
- Total: ~1 hour for professional demo video

### After Recording (30-60 minutes)
1. Review generated video
2. Import video + voice files to editor
3. Sync audio using timing_log.json
4. Add title slide and closing credits
5. Export final MP4 at 1080p
6. Upload for hackathon submission
