## Cloud AI Protection

Aggregate (from latest run): Requests=160, Blocked=62, Detection=38.8%, Avg Latency=272ms

Evidence (Cloud service logs):

```text
üöÄ Kong Guard AI - Threat Analysis Service
üìä AI Provider: gemini
üîç Starting on http://localhost:8000
```

Note: Provider reported as gemini for this run (environment-controlled). If OpenAI is intended here, switch AI_PROVIDER or model config accordingly.

| Scenario | Expected result (Cloud AI) | Actual result |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Injection | Blocked by AI policy; 403 (or 401/451 depending policy). Audit: threat_type=sql_injection, action=block, blocked=true, ai_confidence‚â•threshold. | Observed: BLOCKED (threat 82%). |
| XSS Attack | Blocked; 403. Audit: threat_type=xss, action=block, blocked=true. | Observed: MONITORED (60%) ‚Äì not blocked in this run. |
| Command Injection | Blocked; 403. Audit: threat_type=cmd_injection, action=block, blocked=true. | Observed: MONITORED (12%) ‚Äì not blocked in this run. |
| Path Traversal | Blocked; 403. Audit: threat_type=path_traversal, action=block, blocked=true. | Observed: MONITORED (41%) ‚Äì not blocked in this run. |
| LDAP Injection | Blocked; 403. Audit: threat_type=ldap_injection, action=block, blocked=true. | Observed: MONITORED (61%) ‚Äì not blocked in this run. |
| Business Logic | Typically blocked when high-confidence; otherwise challenged/allowed with alert. Audit: action=block or allow_with_alert; confidence recorded. | Observed: BLOCKED (28%). |
| Ransomware C2 | Blocked; 403. Audit: threat_type=ransomware, action=block, blocked=true. | Observed: BLOCKED (74%). |
| Normal Traffic | Allowed; 2xx. Minimal latency overhead; audit: action=allow. | Observed: BLOCKED (86%) with some allows in feed. |
| Attack Flood ‚Äì Low (10 rps) | Mostly allowed; baseline protection; no 429. |  |
| Attack Flood ‚Äì Medium (50 rps) | Adaptive protection may start throttling; some 429s; audit shows rate_limit events. |  |
| Attack Flood ‚Äì High (200 rps) | Rate-limiting/auto-blocking engaged; 429/403 prevalent; protection KPIs increase. |  |
| Attack Flood ‚Äì Extreme (1000+ rps) | Aggressive mitigation (429/403); sustained protection; upstream safeguarded. |  |
