2. **Feature Selection Process** - Which features matter most
3. **Model Training Parameters** - Optimal hyperparameters discovered
4. **Behavioral Fingerprinting** - User identification methodology
5. **Rate Limiting Prediction** - Predictive algorithm for rate limits

## üìä IP Protection Strategy

### Phase 1: Hackathon (Current)
- Evaluation license only
- No commercial use permitted
- Judges can review for scoring

### Phase 2: Post-Hackathon
**Option A: Full Proprietary**
- Keep all code private
- License to enterprises
- SaaS offering possible

**Option B: Dual License**
- Core framework: MIT License
- ML models: Commercial license
- Community vs Enterprise editions

**Option C: Open Core**
- Basic detection: Open source
- Advanced ML: Proprietary
- Support and training: Paid

## üí∞ Commercialization Potential

### Direct Licensing
- **Enterprise License**: $50K-200K/year per organization
- **OEM License**: $100K-500K for integration rights
- **SaaS Offering**: $1000-5000/month per gateway

### Target Markets
1. **API Gateway Vendors** - License the technology
2. **Security Companies** - OEM integration
3. **Enterprises** - Direct deployment
4. **Cloud Providers** - Managed service offering

### Revenue Projections
- Year 1: $100K-500K (5-10 customers)
- Year 2: $500K-2M (20-40 customers)
- Year 3: $2M-10M (50-200 customers)
