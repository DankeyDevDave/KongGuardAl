# Kong Plugin Integration Validation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the validation strategy for the Kong Guard AI plugin to ensure proper integration with Kong Gateway.

## Phase 1: Environment Validation
- [ ] Docker stack startup validation
- [ ] Kong Gateway accessibility
- [ ] Plugin discovery and loading
- [ ] Basic health checks

## Phase 2: Plugin Loading Validation
- [ ] Plugin file structure validation
- [ ] Kong configuration loading
- [ ] Plugin initialization in Kong
- [ ] Plugin lifecycle hook execution

## Phase 3: Admin API Integration Tests
- [ ] Kong Admin API connectivity
- [ ] Service/Route creation via API
- [ ] Plugin configuration via Admin API
- [ ] Plugin status retrieval

## Phase 4: Plugin Functionality Tests
- [ ] Request interception in access phase
- [ ] Log phase execution
- [ ] Threat detection triggers
- [ ] Automated response mechanisms

## Phase 5: Performance Validation
- [ ] Latency impact measurement (<10ms requirement)
- [ ] Load testing under 5,000 RPS
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] CPU overhead assessment

## Phase 6: Integration Validation
- [ ] Notification system integration
- [ ] Status endpoint accessibility
- [ ] Configuration reload testing
- [ ] Error handling validation

## Test Data Requirements
