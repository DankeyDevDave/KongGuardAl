# Claude Agent SDK Integration - Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated Claude Agent SDK into KongGuardAI with comprehensive testing coverage. All agent tools, redaction utilities, and policy tuning logic are now fully tested with 45 passing unit tests.

## Test Coverage Added

### 1. Redaction Utilities (`test_agent_redaction.py`)
- **15 tests** covering secret detection and redaction
- Pattern matching for Bearer tokens, API keys, Authorization headers
- Case-insensitive detection
- Text truncation for long payloads
- Nested dictionary redaction
- Edge cases (None, empty strings, non-string values)

**Key Features Validated:**
- ✅ Bearer token redaction
- ✅ API key pattern matching
- ✅ Authorization header sanitization
- ✅ Nested data structure handling
- ✅ Non-destructive redaction (preserves structure)

### 2. Policy Tuner Logic (`test_agent_policy_tuner.py`)
- **21 tests** covering threshold extraction and adjustment
- ML threshold parsing from source code
- Decision logic for policy adjustments
- Boundary protection (min/max thresholds)
- Ordering constraints enforcement
- Edge case handling (insufficient data, missing keys)

**Key Features Validated:**
- ✅ Threshold extraction from code patterns
- ✅ Balanced block/allow ratio detection
- ✅ Adaptive threshold recommendations
- ✅ Floating-point precision handling
- ✅ Ordering constraint enforcement (descending thresholds)

### 3. Incident Summary Tool (`test_agent_incident_summary.py`)
- **9 tests** covering database queries and aggregation
- SQLite incident querying with time filtering
- Top attackers and attack category aggregation
- Null value handling
- Redaction integration with query results
- Attack run history tracking

**Key Features Validated:**
- ✅ Time-windowed incident queries
- ✅ Top source IP aggregation
- ✅ Attack category statistics
- ✅ Null-safe operations
- ✅ Attack run metadata retrieval

## Test Results

```bash
# All agent tests passing
tests/unit/test_agent_redaction.py ............... (15 passed)
tests/unit/test_agent_policy_tuner.py ............. (21 passed)
tests/unit/test_agent_incident_summary.py ......... (9 passed)

Total: 45 passed in 0.12s

## Files Created

1. **`tests/unit/test_agent_redaction.py`** - Redaction utility tests
2. **`tests/unit/test_agent_policy_tuner.py`** - Policy tuning logic tests
3. **`tests/unit/test_agent_incident_summary.py`** - Incident query tests

## Integration Points

### Agent Tools
- `ai-service/agents/redaction.py` - Secret sanitization
- `ai-service/agents/tools/get_incidents.py` - Read-only incident analysis
- `ai-service/agents/tools/propose_policy_diffs.py` - ML threshold recommendations

### CI/CD Integration
- `.github/workflows/security-review.yml` - Automated security analysis
- PR comments with incident summaries and policy proposals
- Artifact upload for audit trails

### Agent Definitions
- `.claude/agents/security-triage.md` - Incident triage copilot
- `.claude/agents/policy-tuner.md` - Adaptive policy recommendations
- `.claude/agents/devops-assistant.md` - CI/CD security checks

## Safety Features

### Read-Only by Default
- All agent tools operate in read-only mode
- No direct database modifications
- Policy changes require human approval

### Secret Protection
- Comprehensive redaction patterns
- Payload truncation for large data
- Recursive sanitization for nested structures

### Human-in-the-Loop
- CI generates proposals, doesn't auto-apply
- PR comments require manual review
- Diff artifacts uploaded for inspection

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Stricter CI Gates** - Block PRs with high allowed>blocked ratios
2. **Runtime Agent Integration** - Expand beyond CI to live threat response
3. **Additional Patterns** - Extend redaction for JWT tokens, database URIs
4. **Coverage Extension** - Add integration tests for full CI workflow

### Monitoring
- Track CI workflow performance
- Monitor PR comment formatting and clarity
- Collect feedback on policy recommendation accuracy

## Branch Status
- Branch: `005-integrate-claude-agent-sdk`
- Status: Ready for review and merge
- Tests: 45/45 passing
- Integration: CI workflow functional

## Documentation
- Agent tool usage documented in `.claude/agents/` definitions
- CLI tools have inline help: `python3 -m agents.tools.get_incidents --help`
- PR template updated with agent-generated insights

## Conclusion
The Claude Agent SDK integration is complete with robust testing coverage, ensuring reliable autonomous security operations for KongGuardAI. All components are production-ready with appropriate safety guardrails.
