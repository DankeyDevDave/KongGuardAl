# Kong Guard AI - Hackathon Submission

## 📝 Project Description

**Kong Guard AI** is an autonomous AI-powered threat detection and response system that transforms Kong Gateway into an intelligent security guardian. Unlike traditional WAFs that rely on static rules, Kong Guard AI uses real AI models (Gemini, GPT-4, Groq) to autonomously detect, analyze, and block sophisticated API threats in real-time - including zero-day attacks that rules can't catch.

### Problem It Solves
APIs are under constant attack from increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional security solutions require manual rule updates and fail against novel attacks. Kong Guard AI solves this by giving APIs an intelligent guardian that thinks, learns, and acts autonomously to protect them.

### Agentic AI Theme Alignment
Kong Guard AI embodies true agentic behavior:
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: AI independently analyzes each request and decides whether to block, rate-limit, or allow
- **Takes Initiative**: Proactively identifies suspicious patterns without being told what to look for
- **Learns and Adapts**: Builds threat intelligence from attacks to improve future decisions
- **Real-World Impact**: Makes split-second security decisions that prevent data breaches

## 🎯 Key Features

### Agentic Capabilities
- **Zero-Day Protection**: AI understands attack intent, not just patterns
- **Sub-100ms Decisions**: Fast enough for production without impacting users
- **Graduated Response**: Autonomously chooses between monitor → rate-limit → block
- **Context-Aware**: Considers IP reputation, request history, and behavioral patterns

### Technical Innovation
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Gemini Flash 2.5, GPT-4, Groq, Ollama
- **Real-Time Visualization**: WebSocket dashboard shows AI thinking process
- **Native Kong Plugin**: Deep integration with Kong Gateway 3.8
- **Enterprise Ready**: Docker, Kubernetes, horizontal scaling

## 📹 Video Script

### Opening (0:00-0:15)
"APIs are under constant attack. Traditional security can't keep up. Meet Kong Guard AI - the first truly autonomous AI security guard for your APIs."

### Problem (0:15-0:30)
"Static rules fail against new attacks. Security teams are overwhelmed. APIs get breached. We need intelligence, not patterns."

### Solution Demo (0:30-2:30)
[Show live dashboard]
"Kong Guard AI uses real AI - Gemini, GPT-4 - to analyze every request in real-time."

[Click SQL injection attack]
"Watch as AI detects this SQL injection - see the thinking indicator? AI is analyzing intent, not matching patterns."
