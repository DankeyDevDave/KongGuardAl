## 🚀 **Key Innovation: AI Security Agents**

### **Autonomous Agent Types**
- **Security Agent**: Real-time threat detection and blocking
- **Analyst Agent**: Traffic pattern analysis and anomaly detection  
- **Researcher Agent**: Threat intelligence gathering and pattern research
- **Coordinator Agent**: Multi-agent orchestration and resource allocation
- **Optimizer Agent**: Performance tuning while maintaining security

### **Intelligent Coordination**
```lua
-- Kong Guard AI automatically spawns agents based on threat level
if threat_confidence > 0.8 then
    spawn_security_team({"security", "analyst", "coordinator"})
    coordinate_response("high_severity_threat", threat_data)
end
```
