# Kong Guard AI â€“ Screen Recording Step Guide

This walkthrough mirrors the live attack dashboard (`visualization/index.html`) to ensure every highlight aligns with the actual UI components.

## Pre-Flight Checklist
- Start services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-presentation.yml up -d`.
- Confirm Kong Guard AI plugin health: `curl http://localhost:8001/status` and Kong Admin UI plugin list.
- Open the attack dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` and refresh to clear prior events.
- Prepare two supporting terminals:
  1. **Attack Simulator:** ready for `./scripts/simulate-attacks.sh`.
  2. **Metrics Monitor (optional):** `watch "curl -s http://localhost:8001/_guard_ai/metrics | jq"`.
- Disable notifications, set recorder to 1080p30, and verify microphone input.

## Scene 1 Â· Overview & Status (0:00 â€“ 0:30)
1. Begin on the dashboard header showing the "ðŸŸ¢ Connected" badge; toggle network/click to demonstrate live state if desired.
2. Hover over the six metric tiles (`Total Requests`, `Threats Blocked`, `Safe Requests`, `Current RPS`, `Avg Latency`, `AI Accuracy`).
3. Cut briefly to Terminal: run `docker-compose ps` to confirm services, then return to the dashboard.

## Scene 2 Â· Architecture Context (0:30 â€“ 1:15)
1. Switch to the architecture slide from `PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md` (or preloaded graphic) and point out the client â†’ Kong â†’ AI â†’ decision flow.
2. Return to the dashboard and highlight the "Threat Flow Visualization" section to mirror the same path in real-time.

## Scene 3 Â· Attack Simulator Showcase (1:15 â€“ 2:00)
1. Focus on the "ðŸŽ¯ Attack Simulator" card.
2. Click `Normal Traffic` to establish baseline activity (observe low threat score in feed).
3. Trigger `SQL Injection`, `XSS Attack`, and `DDoS Burst` buttons with ~3 second spacing.
4. Point to updates in `AI Analysis Engine` (threat distribution bars) and scroll the `Live Threat Feed` to show new entries.

## Scene 4 Â· Full Demo Sequence (2:00 â€“ 3:00)
1. Press `ðŸŽ¬ Run Demo Sequence` to launch the scripted pattern.
2. Alternate between Terminal output (`./scripts/simulate-attacks.sh`) and dashboard events to show real traffic correlation.
3. Zoom on any high-threat event card to showcase method, path, threat score, action, and IP.

## Scene 5 Â· AI Reasoning & Metrics (3:00 â€“ 3:45)
1. Capture the `ðŸ§  AI Analysis Engine` overlay when reasoning spinner appears; pause to read the status text.
2. Highlight the `Threat Distribution` bars adjusting live.
3. Show the metrics terminal for JSON output, then cross-reference matching values on the dashboard tiles.

## Scene 6 Â· Developer Controls (3:45 â€“ 4:15)
1. Run commands like `/swarm-status detailed` or `/kong-security threats` (from demo scripts) to display agent coordination.
2. Show a snippet of the plugin configuration (`kong-plugin/kong/plugins/kong-guard-ai/schema.lua` or admin API example) to demonstrate manageability.

## Scene 7 Â· Closing Metrics & CTA (4:15 â€“ 4:45)
1. Return to the top of the dashboard; linger on the `Threat Flow Visualization` animation.
2. Overlay a slide with key metrics (95%+ accuracy, <10 ms latency, multi-provider AI support).
3. End on the dashboard header as audio/video fades out.

## Post-Recording Tasks
- Trim to 4:30â€“5:00 minutes, normalize audio, and export at 1080p.
- Review playback to confirm all dashboard elements are visible and synchronized.
- Upload privately/unlisted, gather the share link, and prepare it for the submission form.
