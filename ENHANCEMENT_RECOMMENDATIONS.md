## Outstanding Items ‚Äî Detailed Implementation Plan

### Normalize Incoming Traffic (URLs and Bodies)
- **Objective**: Ensure semantically equivalent requests are analyzed identically to reduce evasion via encoding/format tricks while preserving original bytes for forensics.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] Implement URL canonicalization module (`kong-plugin/kong/plugins/kong-guard-ai/normalizer.lua`)
    - [ ] Normalize percent-encoding (uppercase hex, decode unreserved, preserve reserved)
    - [ ] Apply Unicode NFC normalization on path/query components
    - [ ] Resolve dot-segments (`.`/`..`) and collapse repeated slashes
    - [ ] Lowercase scheme/host, preserve case in path where required
    - [ ] Stable sort query parameters; preserve duplicates with list semantics
    - [ ] Add size/complexity guardrails (max segments, max params)
  - [ ] Integrate URL canonicalization in `handler.lua` early in `access` phase (before detection)
  - [ ] Implement request body normalization
    - [ ] JSON: parse with tolerant decoder, normalize numbers/booleans/nulls, stable key order for hashing, strip insignificant whitespace
    - [ ] Form-urlencoded: decode pairs, normalize keys to stable order, enforce max key/value sizes
    - [ ] Multipart: normalize part headers, filenames, and content-type casing; hash large file parts instead of loading fully
    - [ ] Content-type aware passthrough for binary/non-supported types
  - [ ] Add config toggles in `schema.lua`
    - [ ] `normalize_url` (default: true), `normalize_body` (default: false), `normalization_profile` (e.g., "strict" | "lenient")
    - [ ] Per-route overrides and allowlist of parameters to exclude from sorting
  - [ ] Persist original request artifacts for audit (e.g., attach `original_url`, `original_body_hash` to analytics)
  - [ ] Documentation: normalization behavior, edge cases, and migration notes
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Canonicalization produces identical outputs for semantically equivalent inputs across a documented corpus
  - Detection operates on canonicalized form; audit retains originals
  - Toggleable behavior via plugin config; defaults are safe and documented
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Unit: table-driven tests for URL/body cases (ASCII, Unicode, mixed encodings)
  - Integration: `pongo` tests verifying `access` phase uses canonicalized values
  - Fuzz: bounded-random inputs to assert no crashes and time/memory caps

### Protocol Analysis: GraphQL and gRPC Payload Inspection
- **Objective**: Add protocol-aware analysis to reduce false negatives in modern API traffic.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] GraphQL support
    - [ ] Detect GraphQL via content-type and heuristic query patterns
    - [ ] Parse operation names, variables, and basic AST (selection sets, depth, fragments)
    - [ ] Implement depth/complexity limits and recursion guard
    - [ ] Add rule set for known risky fields/directives (e.g., introspection when disabled)
    - [ ] Integrate GraphQL signals into scoring pipeline and analytics
  - [ ] gRPC support
    - [ ] Capture service/method from `:authority` and path (`/Service/Method`)
    - [ ] Enforce message size and rate limits per method profile
    - [ ] Optional: support protobuf descriptors when available for field-aware allow/deny checks
    - [ ] Map gRPC status codes to incident taxonomy
  - [ ] Configuration: enable per-protocol toggles and per-route method allowlists
  - [ ] Documentation: deployment guidance and examples
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - GraphQL: depth/complexity breaches are detected and blocked/logged per policy
  - gRPC: per-method policies apply; oversized/abusive streams are curtailed
  - No regressions on non-GraphQL/gRPC traffic
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Integration: sample GraphQL queries (benign/malicious), gRPC echo and streaming scenarios
  - Load: verify latency impact within SLOs under mixed protocol traffic

### TLS Fingerprinting: JA3/JA4 Capture and Enrichment
- **Objective**: Strengthen bot and anomaly detection by correlating client TLS fingerprints.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] Add pluggable JA3/JA4 source
    - [ ] Primary: ingest from upstream edge/header (`X-JA3`, `X-JA4`)
    - [ ] Secondary (best-effort): compute via `lua-resty-*` if supported by runtime; degrade gracefully if unavailable
  - [ ] Enrich request context with fingerprint, ASN, and reputation hits
  - [ ] Add caching with TTL and eviction
  - [ ] Configuration: enable/disable, header names, compute vs ingest preference
  - [ ] Documentation: deployment patterns (e.g., Envoy/Cloudflare adding headers)
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Fingerprint present in analytics for ‚â•95% TLS requests when upstream provides headers
  - Detection rules can score on suspicious JA3/JA4 values
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Unit: fingerprint parsing/validation
  - Integration: simulate edge-provided headers, verify enrichment and scoring

### Threat Intelligence Integration: STIX/TAXII + Dark Web Monitoring
- **Objective**: Continuously ingest and apply external IOCs to enhance detections.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] TAXII 2.1 feeder service (`ai-service/threat_intel_ingestor.py`)
    - [ ] Poll collections, de-duplicate, and map to internal IOC schema (domains, IPs, hashes, URLs, emails)
    - [ ] Store in Redis/DB-backed cache with versioning and TTL
    - [ ] Expose lightweight `/health` and metrics (ingest rate, lag)
  - [ ] Plugin-side IOC cache bridge
    - [ ] Async refresh with backoff; cold-start bootstrap
    - [ ] Match requests against IOC sets in hot path with O(1) lookups
  - [ ] Configuration: TAXII server/collections, polling interval, IOC types to enable
  - [ ] Dark web monitoring evaluation
    - [ ] Identify vendors/APIs; define data contract and privacy constraints
    - [ ] Proof-of-concept ingest pipeline behind feature flag
  - [ ] Documentation and runbooks
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - New IOCs propagate to enforcement within agreed SLA (e.g., ‚â§10 minutes)
  - False positive rate controlled via allowlists and IOC confidence thresholds
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Integration: mock TAXII server in CI; end-to-end IOC match on sample traffic
  - Resilience: simulate feed outages and verify graceful degradation

### Cloud-Native Security Posture: Service Mesh and Kubernetes Metadata
- **Objective**: Enrich detections with workload identity and cluster context.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] K8s metadata enricher (`kong-plugin/kong/plugins/kong-guard-ai/k8s_enricher.lua`)
    - [ ] Read mesh/ingress-provided headers (e.g., `X-Envoy-Downstream-Service-Cluster`, `X-Envoy-External-Address`, `traceparent`)
    - [ ] Optionally read pod/workload labels via Downward API or sidecar and inject as headers at edge; consume in plugin
    - [ ] Map identity to policies (namespace, service account, workload name)
  - [ ] Istio/Linkerd correlation
    - [ ] Recognize B3/W3C trace contexts; stitch traces to incidents
    - [ ] Per-workload rate/policy overrides
  - [ ] Configuration: enable, header mappings, label allowlists
  - [ ] Documentation: examples for Istio and Linkerd deployments
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Incidents enriched with namespace/workload identity when available
  - Policies can target mesh/K8s attributes
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Integration: simulated mesh headers in `pongo` tests
  - E2E: optional KinD-based smoke test (documented, non-blocking in CI)

### Documentation & Configuration (Cross-Cutting)
- **Objective**: Ship operator-grade documentation and safe defaults for all new capabilities.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] Update `KONG_GUARD_AI_USER_GUIDE.md` and deployment docs with new config flags and examples
  - [ ] Add migration notes highlighting defaults and rollback steps
  - [ ] Provide troubleshooting section and known limitations
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - Docs contain copy-pastable examples and clearly marked defaults
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Docs lint (links/examples), review checklist; run sample configurations in CI smoke jobs

### Delivery & Governance
- **Objective**: Land changes safely with traceability.
- **Subtasks**
  - [ ] Feature flags for each major capability (normalization, GraphQL, gRPC, JA3/JA4, TI, K8s)
  - [ ] Dashboards and alerts for new metrics (normalization rates, TI freshness, JA3 coverage)
  - [ ] ADRs capturing key design decisions
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - All features are independently toggleable; metrics visible in Grafana

### Suggested Delivery Order (6‚Äì10 weeks)
1. Normalize Incoming Traffic
2. Protocol Analysis (GraphQL ‚Üí gRPC)
3. TLS Fingerprinting (ingest-first)
4. Threat Intelligence (TAXII baseline)
5. Cloud-Native Enrichment
6. Documentation & Governance wrap-up

> Assumption: Redis is available for IOC caching; if not, fall back to in-process LRU with shorter TTLs.
