   - Accessible at http://localhost:8080
   - Server responding (nginx/1.29.1)

2. **Recording system works** ✅
   - Video capture functional
   - Screenshots working
   - Visual effects injected

3. **Scene 1 completed** ✅
   - Full 30 seconds recorded
   - Both screenshots captured
   - Visual effects visible

4. **Voice narration ready** ✅
   - All 7 scenes generated
   - Algieba voice for Scene 7
   - Total 6.8 MB ready to use

## ⚠️ Why It Stopped Early

Based on the 37-second duration (30s Scene 1 + 7s extra):

### Most Likely Causes

1. **Manual Interruption**
   - User pressed Ctrl+C or closed browser
   - Recording stopped intentionally

2. **Dashboard State Change**
   - Dashboard page navigated away
   - JavaScript error occurred
   - Dashboard became unresponsive

3. **Selector Issue in Scene 2**
   - Scene 2 selector failed
   - Recording couldn't proceed
   - Auto-terminated after timeout

4. **Browser Closed**
   - Playwright browser closed unexpectedly
   - Connection lost to dashboard

## 🎯 Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Full Re-recording (Recommended)

Since Scene 1 worked perfectly, just re-run the full recording:

```bash
# Ensure dashboard is accessible
open http://localhost:8080

# Wait for dashboard to fully load (30 seconds)

# Start recording again
source .env && ./hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots --narrator-timing
```

**Important**: 
- Let it run for full 4:45 minutes
- Don't close browser or interrupt
- Keep terminal visible to monitor progress

### Option 2: Record Without Button Clicks (Safest)

If dashboard has dynamic elements causing issues, use passive recording:

```bash
# Records dashboard only (no interactions)
source .env && ./hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots
```

This uses the "passive recording" approach we configured - just shows the dashboard for 4:45 with visual highlights.

### Option 3: Use Static Dashboard File

If the live dashboard is problematic:

```bash
# Record from static HTML file
python3 hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots \
  --url file:///Users/jacques/DevFolder/KongGuardAI/visualization/index.html
```

### Option 4: Manual Screen Recording + AI Voice

Most reliable for hackathon deadline:

1. **Manual screen recording**:
   ```bash
   # Mac built-in screen recording
   # Press Cmd+Shift+5 -> Record Entire Screen
   # Open dashboard and record for 4:45
   ```

2. **Combine with AI voices**:
   - Use video editor (iMovie, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve)
   - Import your screen recording
   - Import all 7 WAV voice files
   - Align voices at correct timestamps
   - Export as MP4

## 🔧 Quick Diagnostic Commands

### Check Dashboard Status

```bash
# Is dashboard accessible?
curl http://localhost:8080

# Open in browser to verify
open http://localhost:8080

# Check for JavaScript errors in console
# (Open browser dev tools: Cmd+Option+I)
```

### Check Services

```bash
# What's running?
docker ps

# Or check processes
ps aux | grep -E 'kong|redis|nginx|python'
```

### Test Video Playback

```bash
# Watch what was captured
open demo_recordings/hackathon_demo_20250930_054022/b23af45e6d9f32d29311dd7f09e96d47.webm
```

## 📋 Pre-Recording Checklist

Before attempting another recording:

- [ ] Dashboard loads at http://localhost:8080 ✅ (confirmed)
- [ ] Dashboard shows all visual elements
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Dashboard remains stable for 5+ minutes
- [ ] Terminal window visible to monitor progress
- [ ] Don't click anything during recording
- [ ] Let it run completely (4:45 minutes)
- [ ] Don't close browser or interrupt

## 💡 Quick Retry Command

Since dashboard is running and Scene 1 worked:

```bash
# Just retry - it should work!
cd /Users/jacques/DevFolder/KongGuardAI && \
source .env && \
./hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots --narrator-timing
```

## 🚨 If Recording Keeps Failing

### Fallback Plan

1. **Use the partial video** you have (Scene 1)
2. **Record manually** for the rest (Scenes 2-7)
3. **Or** use screen recording for full 4:45
4. **Add voice narration** in video editor using your 7 WAV files

You already have the hardest part done - **professional voice narration for all 7 scenes!** The video is just visual footage.

## 📊 Current Status

```
Voice Narration:  ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅  100% COMPLETE (7/7 scenes)
Video Recording:  ✅⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳   14% COMPLETE (1/7 scenes)
Screenshots:      ✅✅⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳   12% COMPLETE (2/17 files)
```

## 🎯 Next Action

**Recommended**: Try recording one more time. Dashboard is running, Scene 1 worked, just let it complete:

```bash
source .env && ./hackathon_demo_recorder.py --headed --screenshots
```

**Watch for**: 
- Progress messages in terminal
- Recording should take exactly 4:45
- Don't interrupt or close browser
- You'll see "Scene X/7" progress indicators
