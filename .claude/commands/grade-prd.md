   **4.6 Configuration**
   - ✓ Declarative YAML configuration
   - ✓ Dry-run mode support
   - ✓ Status endpoint

4. **Evaluate Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance: Check for <10ms latency design

   - Kong 3.x+ compatibility
   - Security practices review

5. **Check Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Docker deployment (`docker-compose*.yml`)
   - Testing scripts in `scripts/`
   - Documentation quality (README.md)
   - Configuration examples

6. **Security Assessment**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure storage of sensitive data
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Error handling without information disclosure

7. **Calculate Grades**

   - **Completeness (40 points)**
     - All PRD features implemented: 40/40
     - Missing features: -5 points each
   
   - **Correctness (25 points)**
     - Proper Kong integration: 10/10
     - Accurate threat detection: 10/10
     - Working response actions: 5/5
   
   - **Security (20 points)**
     - Secure coding practices: 10/10
     - Input validation: 5/5
     - Data protection: 5/5
   
   - **Performance (10 points)**
     - Meets <10ms latency: 5/5
     - Stateless design: 5/5
   
   - **Documentation (5 points)**
     - Clear README: 3/3
     - Configuration examples: 2/2
